# Python Today Project
In this project we will learn some skills about git and python. However, python is one of the most important languages today.
```python
def get_student_info(sid):
    print("student info", sid)
```

## Use Git Remotly
Todya we will talk about remote refs in git. However, one of the most important commands in git is `git push`. Check the follwing example.
```git
git push origin xyz
```
In this example I used **push** command to _upload_ repo content.
